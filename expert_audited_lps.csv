It would violate Catholic social teaching to force Catholic Charities to be “absorbed and substituted” by “social entities of a higher level.” Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church ¶ 186. Wisconsin’s decision to deny Catholic Charities the Section 108.02(15)(h) exemption unless it merges with the Diocese thus penalizes it for following specific Catholic teachings about church governance. In a host of church autonomy decisions stretching back over a century, this Court has rejected similar attempts by state governments to meddle with the inner workings of churches. The Religion Clauses, working together, protect religious bodies’ “independence from secular control or manipulation, in short, power to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church government as well as those of faith and doctrine.” Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in N. Am., 344 U.S. 94, 116 (1952). And once church authorities decide a question of church government, “the Constitution requires that civil courts accept their decisions as binding upon them.” Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese for U.S. of Am. & Can. v. Milivojevich, 426 U.S. 696, 725 (1976).",accept,,,,

The Religion Clauses do not allow “active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.” Walz v. Tax Comm’n of N.Y., 397 U.S. 664, 668 (1970). Nor do they allow governments (including courts) to decide whether religious institutions “correctly perceive[ ] the commands” of their religion, Thomas v. Review Board, 450 U.S. 707, 716 (1981), or to “second-guess” their beliefs, Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, 591 U.S. 732, 751 (2020). Yet here, Wisconsin has taken it upon itself to override the Catholic Church’s beliefs about whether (for example) helping those with developmental disabilities is a religious act, and to force Catholic Charities to participate in the State’s unemployment compensation system on that basis. That is entanglement forbidden by the Constitution.",accept,,,,

Under the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s test, religious groups that serve only those of their own faith or that proselytize can obtain the tax exemption, as can religious groups with a simpler internal structure. But Catholic Charities cannot enjoy the tax exemption because it follows particular Catholic beliefs and has a particular Catholic polity. That cannot be squared with the rule against denominational discrimination articulated in Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228 (1982) and Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.

Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 218, 232 (1972). Children in elementary school are at the most formative stage of their lives and are highly impressionable and vulnerable to peer pressure—espe-cially on such potent and religiously laden topics as gender and sexuality. In Yoder, the Court held that subjecting high schoolers to an educational environment that incidentally conflicted with their religious beliefs justified parents withdrawing them from public school entirely. Petitioners’ much narrower request to opt their children out from discrete instruction that deliberately seeks to confound their religious values compels the same result. The longstanding consensus of states deferring to parents on when and how their children will receive sex education confirms that compelled instruction against their religious beliefs substantially interferes with Petitioners’ free exercise right.",accept,,,,

Contrary to petitioners’ assertion, the government is not required to show that Congress would have adopted the Act had it been concerned about data collection alone, and not also covert manipulation. A statute that is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest can be sustained on that basis even if Congress also sought to further other interests that may not satisfy strict scrutiny.",accept,,,,
